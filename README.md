# Radioactive Decay Simulation

A clean, well-tested toolkit to simulate radioactive decay and reproduce the exponential law.  
Includes both **analytical exponential decay** and a **stochastic Monte Carlo model**, with support for multiple isotopes.

## üî¨ Physics Background
For a species with decay constant Œª and half-life:

\[
T_{1/2} = \frac{\ln 2}{\lambda}
\]

The number of undecayed nuclei at time *t* is:

\[
N(t) = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}, \quad A(t)=\lambda N(t)
\]

In the Monte Carlo model, each nucleus decays in a small time step Œît with probability:

\[
p = 1 - e^{-\lambda \Delta t} \approx \lambda \Delta t
\]

## üöÄ Features
- **Two engines**: analytical model and Monte Carlo
- **Multi-isotope support** (mixtures, independent chains)
- **Config-driven runs** via YAML
- **Command-line interface (CLI)** for easy runs
- **Results saved** as CSV + plots (PNG)
- **Unit tests** with `pytest` for reliability
